# GNOME Tweaks & Extensions

GNOME Tweaks and GNOME Shell Extensions provide additional customization beyond the Settings menu.

## GNOME Tweaks

GNOME Tweaks is an optional software package allowing users to further customize the appearance and behavior of Pop!\_OS. GNOME Tweaks features include changing power settings, managing startup applications, enabling desktop icons, and changing fonts.

### Install GNOME Tweaks

Launch the Pop!_Shop from the dock.
Search “gnome tweaks”.

## GNOME Shell Extensions

Are features written by third party developers that build upon the GNOME Shell. Extensions are similar to Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons. Extensions are available from https://extensions.gnome.org.

A web browser plugin is needed to interact with the site, and it will prompt for installation if needed. Remember to refresh the page after the plugin is installed.
