## GNOME Shell Extensions

GNOME shell extensions are features written by third party developers that build upon the GNOME Shell. Extensions are similar to Chrome Extensions or Firefox Addons. Extensions are available from https://extensions.gnome.org.

A web browser plugin is needed to interact with the site, and it will prompt for installation if needed. Remember to refresh the page after the plugin is installed.
