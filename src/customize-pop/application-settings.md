# Application Settings

Installed applications can be customized to open specific file types, have unique notification behavior, and to access specific system services or resources.

- [The `Applications` tab](/customize-pop/application-settings.md#applications) provides settings to manage application permissions, system integration features, default handlers, and disk space usage. The availability of these settings depends on the functions and access required by the application.
- [The `Notifications`](/customize-pop/application-settings.md#default-applications) tab provides more fine-tuning of application-specific notification behavior by providing additional control over which applications display notifications, what notifications are displayed, and where they are displayed.
- [The `Default Applications`](/customize-pop/application-settings.md#default-applications) tab provides a simplified menu for specifying an app that should always open a certain file type.

- `Permissions & Access`: These settings display data and system services the app has requested or requires. These can include access to system devices, using the system's network connection, reading and writing to the file system, and the ability to change settings. Many applications will include built-in permissions that cannot be modified by the user. You can view permission granted to an application by clicking the `Built-in Permissions` button.

- `Integration`: These settings refer to system-wide features used by an application. These features include the ability to appear in search, display notification, and running in the background.

- `Default handlers`: These settings determine which file types are associated with an application. Click an entry to display more information about the file types assigned to the application. Multiple programs can be associated with the same file types. See the [Default Applications](/customize-pop/application-settings.md#default-applications) to specify an application that should always open a certain media type.

- `Usage`: This displays the disk usage used by the application. Click on the `Storage` button to view space used by the application itself, data created by the application, and temporary data cached by the application. You can clear cache data by clicking `Clear Cache`.

## Notifications

Application notifications appear in the upper center of the screen. Click the date and time to view recent notifications.
