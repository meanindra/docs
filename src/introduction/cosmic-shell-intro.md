# C.O.S.M.I.C. & the Pop!\_Shell

This section describes COSMIC and the Pop!\_Shell, the two main GUI components of Pop!\_OS.

## COSMIC

C.O.S.M.I.C. stands for Computer Operating System Main Interface Components. COSMIC is the name for the main shell components in Pop_Shell (separate from the tiling and window-management components). It makes the following changes to the standard GNOME Shell environment:

- The Dock
- Workspaces
- Configuration options via the Pop Desktop Settings Widget
- Mousepad gestures for navigating between applications
- A Workspaces overview that has been separated from the Applications menu
