# Navigate Files and Folders

Pop!\_OS uses a file browser called Nautilus to graphically browse files and folders stored on the system and in connected cloud storage accounts. In Linux, a user's data is stored in their Home directory by default.

---

## The Home Directory

In Linux, each user account is provisioned with their own `/home` folder. This is where data from regular user activities will accumulate. A user's Home directory contains these common folders:

- Desktop
- Documents
- Downloads
- Music
- Pictures
- Public
- Templates
- Videos

## Using Nautilus to Find Your Files

Click Files from the Dock to launch the file browser.
